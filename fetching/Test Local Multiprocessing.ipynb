    "    - Program was tested on a local Windows machine\n",
    "    - Porting to AWS should be possible, threading in Dash should work too.\n",
    "    - The Task is I/O bound, meaning it's limited by request time (reading time) and is rather a light weight CPU task.\n",
    "        - A ThreadPool is usually more suited for a I/O bound task than a Pool\n",
